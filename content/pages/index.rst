Hi, I'm Manu, and I'm an **adventurer**.

My main quest revolves around ecological and environmental issues, and this website is a place where I share thoughts, analysis and rants about them, but also document how I try to deal with them as a permaculture designer, gardener, herbalist, IT guy and human being. 

I have other fields of interest, such as photography, IT and writing, and I'll let them leak through from time to time. Playing around is a great source of inspiration.
