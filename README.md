This is the file structure for a personal, pelican-powered personal website.

I'm licensing this with GNU GPL 3.0 but doesn't really matter: the [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) project has its own license, so every theme and plugin. I'll keep all the licenses in the folders so you can easily get them in case.
